INTRODUCTION
------------

This module allows for direct viewing of a file with the URL alias.  Instead of viewing the media entity and all the
fields users can view a file (like a PDF) but instead of sites/default/files/name-of-file it will display the URL alias.

This is useful if a media object is referenced in multiple locations the media object can be updated with a new file
and reflected in all instances automatically.
